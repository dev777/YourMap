# Unofficial YourMap

This is a little Babylon.js / MeshWriter first time experiment to generate a visual map of the many YourLand Minetest server Cities.
Datas has been collected by players other the years, and we recently updated it, reading books IG, and travelling IG world.

Cities datas Credits : alexandre2005, AliasAlreadyTaken, Bla, Boot, Chache, LichBerry, Mielle and probably many others (help makes this accurate please)

This project was really a test, and if it seems usefull then we'll see what to do with it.

I personnaly needed a visual representation of the world, this may be usefull for others, but we also have to be cautious to not spoil new players or those who strictly prefer to not have more help than the game offers.
Those games are also about exploration, so if you use this : use it with moderation !

OBVIOUSLY this in a WORK IN PROGRESS

Am already glad been able to put something so quickly with not too much hurddles, thx to Babylon.js

Let see if it grows.

--- TO DO ---
* Many things left to do, and it adds up :
- [ ] CODE : add timers, check importing assets and functions times
- [ ] CODE : rewrite textCities infos with 3DGUI OR test with POVs generations
- [ ] CODE : cleaning JSON from server infos ? (needs manual pos)
- [ ] CODE : improve underground cities handling
- [ ] ORG : improve imported mesh selection / naming
- [ ] ORG : Parent city_infos to disc // testing with Transformation nodes actually
- [ ] FIX : Fix panning bug again (focuscam) >> ggrrrr >> maybe try target 3D ui instead ?
- [ ] UI : improve side menu (layout, hover)
- [ ] UI : improve academy display
- [ ] UI : Change text size according to City size/activity
- [ ] UI : needs SSAO & Ambient
- [ ] UI : display actual pointer position (projection invis plane ?)
- [ ] FEATURE : related to above task, add city statistics
- [ ] FEATURE : add a camera collision container OR use the skybox directly
- [ ] PERF : fix duplicated imported materials ()
- [ ] PERF : use LOD
- [ ] FEATURE : add possibility to enter coords (jump to, check closest city/mobility)
- [ ] FEATURE: seperate POVs from Cities, default is "hidden"

- [ ] FEATURE : make city's discs or City name clickable too > then option list (travel, info...)
- [ ] FEATURE : add voice's attack spot and dates, add POVs category
- [ ] FEATURE : add layers displaying mobility paths (boat; zep; rails)

- [ ] IDEA : prototype class game loop
- [ ] IDEA : add possibility to place grid origin at locations, with rotation
- [ ] IDEA : AND / OR add a ruler
- [ ] IDEA : Add registered path (with multilines)
- [ ] IDEA : test flythrough (city to city)
- [ ] IDEA / 3D : obtain a layer 0 of the world (only ocean, river) >> add water only (Global Blender Mesh)

POSTPONNED
- [ ] FEATURE / CONTENT : display more cities datas (shields, quick description, state, alliance, farms, portals, church)
Will have to stop somewhere...
