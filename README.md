# Unofficial YourMap

This is a little Babylon.js / MeshWriter first time experiment to generate a visual map of the many YourLand Minetest server Cities.
Datas has been collected by players other the years, and we recently updated it, reading books IG, and travelling IG world.

Cities datas Credits : alexandre2005, AliasAlreadyTaken, Bla, Boot, Chache, LichBerry, Mielle and probably many others (help makes this accurate please)

This project was really a test, and if it seems usefull then we'll see what to do with it.

I personnaly needed a visual representation of the world, this may be usefull for others, but we also have to be cautious to not spoil new players or those who strictly prefer to not have more help than the game offers.
Those games are also about exploration, so if you use this : use it with moderation !

OBVIOUSLY this in a WORK IN PROGRESS

Am already glad been able to put something so quickly with not too much hurddles, thx to Babylon.js

Let see if it grows.
